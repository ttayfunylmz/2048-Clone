## Unity Version
* We used Unity version <b>2022.3.3f1</b> for this project. However, you can open it with any Unity version since it is a small project.

## Features We've Used

* Scriptable Objects
  - We used Scriptable Objects for our Tiles and their colors. Therefore, we handled our coloring easily by storing the Color data in our "TileStateSO.cs" script.
* Events & Unity Events
  - We used some Events in our code to make the code suitable for clean code principles and we make sure that the  communication between core mechanic scripts and UI scripts such as displaying the UI is happening.
* Singleton Pattern
  - Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
* Observer Pattern
  - Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
